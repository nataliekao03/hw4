1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
    No, it doesn't change the variable after the function call because it is a pass by value
    so therefore the value changed in the function won't affect the value outside of the function 
    and it will not change
2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
    Yes, becasue it is a pass by reference since it is a dictionary and the key-value pair will be changed 
    when the function is called
3. If they differ answer why? if not why not?
    The answers differ because one is passed by value, which doesn't change affect the variable after a function call
    while the other is passed by reference , which changes the variable outside the function. When passed by value, there is 
    an independent copy of that variable in memory but when passed by reference, the argument you are passing to the function
    is a reference to a variable that already exists in memory so value types will remain unchanged
